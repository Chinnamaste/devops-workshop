# Welcome to the first Mimmitcode virtual workshop organized by IBM!

We are really excited that we have been offered such a tremendous opportunity to get to lead this workshop.
While the global situation does not currently allow for face-to-face workshops, we at IBM do not want this to become an obstacle.
We still want to introduce women to this tremendous field with thousands of opportunities and trends. This time we offer an opportunity to take a peek into the world of OpenShift. 

Cloud services and solutions are the future and more and more companies want managed solutions so they can focus on their business and let IT services take care of themselves. This, of course, means that we need more experts in the cloud world who could develop and maintain these solutions. Understanding cloud services is a really important skill in the IT industry, even if you are not a developer. Salespeople need know, how cloud works, so that they be able to explain services to a customer, project managers need to understand the implementations of the solutions in order to keep the project schedule under control. So as you can see, there are several different trends in the IT industry that require such expertise. So don’t be afraid but join in to explore this new cloud era.

# About
With this course, you don’t have to be full time devloper. However, you should understand the basics of programming to get the most out of the workshop. However, if you feel that you are quick learner and are willing to do a little more background work then you will do really well on the course. In this workshop, you will learn how to make applications run in an orchestration called OpenShift. We will guide you from start to finish, so at no point will you be left alone with the problem.

# Practical issues
If you don't have a GitHub account yet, we ask that you do it. Namely, all the questions we hope you ask through GitHub. If something goes really tricky and you get totally stuck, then we will schedule a "meeting" through the Team service and solve the problem together. Okey?

We will publish every Friday  the assignments for the following week.
Note that the first week also includes 0 week, as it instructs you on how to create an IBM clound ID.

The course has two instructors Eelia and Jaana.
