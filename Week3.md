 # Managing storage in OpenShift
  

Last week we created a wordpress application that uses mysql as a database. The mysql server that was deployed in a container did not have storage in itself to store the data from the wordpress. For this reason a persistent volume was requested from openshift with a persistent volume claim. 

- OpenShift uses persistent volumes to manage storage. Persistent volumes or PVs enable all kinds of storage to be used with the benefit that the application or the developer does not need to know what or where the storage really is.

- OpenShift Administrators can create PVs that can be storage for example from Cloud, NFS server or VMware VMDK storage. Check more about PVs here: https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/4.4/storage/understanding-persistent-storage.html

- Developers can request storage for their applications by creating a PersistentVolumeClaim or PVC. The developers tells the PVC, how much storage the application needs and what type of storage it needs if the OpenShift cluster has multiple storage options. The PVC then automatically grabs and binds the most appropriate PersistentVolume for the application. 

# 1. Requesting storage / Creating a Persistent Volume Claim


- PVs can have three different reclaim policies. The reclaim policy of a PersistentVolume tells the cluster what to do with the volume after it is released. A volumeâ€™s reclaim policy is usually either **Retain** or **Delete**
- **a Retain policy keeps the PV and its data alive even if the PVC is deleted. This enables the data to be reused and a new PVC to be bound to it.**
- **a Delete policy deletes the PV and its data when the PVC is deleted.**

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

- First we create a PVC and see how it is bound to a PV. Click **Storage** -> **Persistent Volume Claims**
- Make sure you are in your own project that was created in week 2.
- Click **Create Persistent Volume Claim**
- Choose a StorageClass **ibm-vpc-block-general-purpose**. 
- Choose a name of your choise.
- Set the size as 1 GiB
- Click Create.

- When the PVC has been created, the OpenShift will begin to deploy a PersistentVolume to match the PVC.
- After the PV has been deployed, it will be automatically bound to the PVC and you will see the PVC status change to **Bound**. This means that the PVC now has storage attached to it and an application can start to use the PVC to store it's data. 
- The Binding process can take a few minutes so be patient :)

# 2. Releasing storage / Deleting a Persistent Volume Claim

- Storage can be released by deleting the bound PVC. 
- On the top right, click **Actions** -> **Delete Persistent Volume Claim**

- Confirm the deletion by clicking delete.

# Add Persistent Storage to your mysql application

# 1. Create a PVC

- The apllication that was created last week does not have persistent storage. Let's fix that.
- On the left side of the screen, click **Storage** -> **Persistent Volume Claims**
- Click **Create new Persistent Volume Claim**
- Choose **ibm-vpc-block-retain-general-purpose** as the Storage Class. Here we choose a class with **retain** reclaim policy to keep our data intact even if the application is moved or deleted.
- Set the name as **mysql-pvc** 
- Set the Size as 1 GiB
   + **Hint!** [Check how to create the PVC here](/mysql-pvc.png)

- Wait for the PVC to change into **bound** state.

# 2. Modify your mysql application to use persistent storage

- Open the **Deployment Configs** and click mysql and open the **YAML** tab.
- Check how to attach the local claim to a pod and more about local storage here: https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/4.3/storage/persistent_storage/persistent-storage-local.html

<details><summary>Click here for a hint</summary>
<p>
under spec: volumes: replace the emptyDir {} with persistentVolumeClaim: claimName: mysql-pvc
</p>
</details>

   + [Check the correct yaml here](/mysql-yaml.png)

- Save the deployment config and OpenShift will automatically restart the mysql application. 


# Add Persistent Storage to your wordpress application
 
The wordpress application needs persistent storage as well for the same reasons as the mysql application. Try to add persistent storage for the wordpress application and if you get stuck, check guidance from the part **Add Persistent Storage to your mysql application**. 

- When you have added persistent storage to mysql and wordpress, check that both of them are up and running. Restarting the applications after adding the storage can take up to 5 minutes, just be patient. 
- Go to the **Deployment configs** page and check that both of your apps have a status: **1 out of 1 pods**.
- Next open both applications, scroll down and check that both of them have **Volumes** type: **PVC**.
<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jaanae/devops-workshop/master/volume-pvc.png" width="60%" height="60%">

## If both are running and have volume type PVC, you have succesfully made your application persistent and completed week 3. Yay!

- If you want, you can create your own website by following the guide here: https://themeisle.com/blog/how-to-make-a-website/ Start from the **Step 3**.
- FYI: These applications will be deleted after the course.
